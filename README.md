## What is nCoder 

A set of techniques that can be used to develop, validate, and implement automated classifiers. A powerful tool for transforming raw data into meaningful information, 'ncodeR' (Shaffer, D. W. (2017) Quantitative Ethnography. ISBN: 0578191687) is designed specifically for working with big data: large document collections, logfiles, and other text data.
